# WebVR

This repository consists of my works in WebVR- a browser based virtual reality.
I have used Three.js, Tone.js, and Peer.js for my projects. 

Three.js : Enables 3d object rendering inside the VR environment.
Tone.js : Enables music rendering and interaction inside the VR environment.
Peer.js: Enables Real Time Peer to Peer connection for video calls inside the VR environment. 

Would love any feedback!
